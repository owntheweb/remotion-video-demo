## Setup

**Install Dependencies**

```console
npm i
```

**Connect To OpenWeather and NASA APIs**

Copy `template.env` to `.env` where Remotion will read API access keys for OpenWeather and NASA. [See here](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/env-variables) for more information on how Remotion handles environment variables.

```console
cp template.env .env
```

Obtain an OpenWeather access key for the weather demo by [signing up here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up). The access key can be [found here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) after login to place in the `.env` file `REMOTION_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` variable. Note: Once the email address is verified, it takes up to two hours for the key to become active. To customize the weather location, customize `<Weather ... />` in `src/Composition.tsx`.

Obtain the NASA access key for the Astronomy Picture of the Day demo by visiting the [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) website and filling out the form. An email will be sent with a verification link. Clicking the link will give access to the API key that can be copied into the `.env` file's `REMOTION_NASA_API_KEY` variable.

**Background Music Setup**

The music used in this project isn't included as part of this repository, yet can be downloaded for free with open licensing to post on YouTube and elsewhere courtesy of [StreamBeats](https://www.senpai.tv/streambeats/).

Visit the [audio download page here](ttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IoVhvfigg25IEaW-QNMGuG72U_pxcoI8). Download and copy `9. EZ PZ.wav` to `public/audio/external/`.

## StreamBeats Audio (thank you!)

Audio courtesy of [StreamBeats](https://www.senpai.tv/streambeats/), can be downloaded to this folder for personal, YouTube and streaming use:

- [9. EZ PZ.wav](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IoVhvfigg25IEaW-QNMGuG72U_pxcoI8)
  - Download the song. Move to this folder and ensure name is still "9. EZ PZ.wav" (no name changes for simplicity).

## Other Notes

One issue experienced while developing on a Mac was an error when rendering Three.js animations. A work-around for this was to add this line to `remotion.config.ts`:

```
Config.setChromiumOpenGlRenderer('angle');
```

More on this Chrome version issue can be [found here](https://oss.issuehunt.io/r/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/1761). If this addition is causing issues on non-Mac machines, try disabling the line in `remotion.config.js`.

## Run and Render

**Start Preview**

```console
npm start
```

**Render video**

```console
npm run build
```

**Upgrade Remotion**

```console
npm run upgrade
```

## Using server-side rendering

This template uses a [custom Webpack override](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/webpack). If you are using server-side rendering, you need to import the override function from `./src/webpack-override.ts` and pass it to [`bundle()`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/bundle) (if using SSR) and [`deploySite()`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/deploysite) (if using Lambda).
